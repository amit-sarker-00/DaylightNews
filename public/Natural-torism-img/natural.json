        "description": "Believe it or not, but resisting the alluring charm and appeal of Gangtok is almost impossible for anyone! The capital city of Sikkim, Gangtok is nestled in the Eastern Himalayas and is one of the kaleidoscopic tourist destinations in the state.I was walking on my city bazaar with just Rs. 500 in my pocket and enjoyed buying crackers, clothes, eatables and other Diwali accessories. What a time it was, though being a student with limited money the energy and enjoyment is hyper. But last week same bazaar, with some of my friends, being employed, and Rs. 5000 in hand. We are unable to get the same enjoyment as how we were in our college days..Looking in a microscopic view, the reasons are very obvious that our expectations have increased as how the product line for Diwali have increased. Taking Diwali as a brand, the line earlier had crackers, sweets, and clothing and may be two more in thread. Presently the brand Diwali has more than 20 extensions in its line, the depth is breathtaking, the people are getting sunk in it. which gives a broad idea that;To many products starting from food to smartphones, KFC to AUDI and discounts everywhere, markup, stock reduction. How many are conscious about what is happening around them. Still there are families which buy clothing once in a year during Diwali, are they getting satisfied with the marketing agenda. In Indian context think of a family head, was he/she able to satisfy all the needs of his/her relations. If not, how can that individual be happy for Diwali. Even the essential practice of Diwali has came down drastically.Consider this as a scenario; on the decided budget;earlier, people used to spend 80% on crackers, clothing, and sweets and remaining they used to spend for their other liking. but now:The argument is not whether the above statement is correct, because the money may be spent wisely. But it threads on whether the festivals are celebrated with the same intensity of happiness. Yes, people gets benefited by what they are getting through their money in the whole product line, but somewhere the materialism is pushing them to a origin of dissatisfaction. Think of a Diwali without money, impossible, but there are scenarios when Diwali is not dependent on money. But Diwali now is a dependent variable with a regressive elements present along."
